ðŸ“Š Sales Trend Analysis (Excel Version)
ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this task is to analyze monthly revenue and order volume using Excel instead of SQL. The task demonstrates how to group sales data by month/year, apply aggregations, and visualize sales trends.

ðŸ›  Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Charts, Data Model for distinct count)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains an orders table with the following columns:

order_date â†’ Date of the order

amount â†’ Revenue from the order

order_id â†’ Unique ID for each order

product_id â†’ Product reference

ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed
1. Data Preparation

Added helper columns:

Year â†’ Extracted using =YEAR(order_date)

Month â†’ Extracted using =TEXT(order_date,"MMMM")

2. PivotTable Creation

Inserted a PivotTable from the dataset.

Rows: Year, Month

Values:

SUM(amount) â†’ Monthly Revenue

COUNT DISTINCT(order_id) â†’ Order Volume (using Data Model option in PivotTable)

3. Sorting & Filtering

Sorted data by Revenue and Volume to identify top-performing months.

Filtered for specific years to analyze yearly trends.

4. Visualization

Created Line Chart for revenue trends.

Created Column Chart for order volume comparison.

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome

Identified monthly revenue trends and fluctuations.

Found peak sales months by revenue and volume.

Learned how to use aggregations in Excel (SUM, COUNT DISTINCT) to replicate SQL analysis.
